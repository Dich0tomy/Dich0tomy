Self-taught developer pursuing constant self improvement. I mainly use C++, but I fiddle with lots of other languages.

Big fan of functional programming, Nix(OS) and all things terminal ;d

I keep my GitHub only to contribute and for projects which need CI (I still haven't up my own CI and/or git forge).
